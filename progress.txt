first after kaggle realization = score 0.14317
now I want to exclude extreme values. And score improved! = 0.14050!
now I want to predict not the SalePrice but log of sale price because we have skewness. Aand it also worked - score 0.13858
now let's use kaggle researchers to use unique missing value filling to each columns. funny but score decreased - score 0.14913
let's pepare skewness. Nothing changed. score ~0.15. If we will switch to simple linear regression it will be 0.14944
so, the main thing, that worked last time was feature selection and making a model based only on 30 or so features. I should do it now as well
